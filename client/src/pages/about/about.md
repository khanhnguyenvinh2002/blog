My name is Khanh Nguyen, and I go by Andrew. I'm currently a sophomore at Brandeis University majoring in Computer Science and Business. I was born and grown up in Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam. 

Ever since I was a small kid, I enjoy seeing the world from different perspectives and trying to solve existing problems. During middle school, I came to know about the technology industry and its various opportunities to help shape the world in the foreseeable future.

I went to Hanoi-Amsterdam highschool for the gifted, where I specialized in Mathematics and had won various Maths competition. I enjoy organizing various events where I can help solving on-going problems in the society, from teaching women coding to teaching students natural science intuitively with science experiments. During this time, I also taught myself Python and C++ and enhance my coding skills with CodeForce and HackerRank problems.

Now in Brandeis, I'm studying new coding languages, algorithms, data structures, higher mathematics, all of which I find really useful to help me achieve my goal. Each project I work on has its own story and mission, and certainly, there are more stories out there waiting to be discovered, and more problems waiting to be solved. Finding and solving these problems with technology is what keeps me up all day and night, and I'm excited for what is yet to come.

I will use this platform to write and share my knowledge, experiences and thoughts during my journey with coding, and I hope you can find some interesting ideas or projects here. Feel free to message me if you have any ideas and we can turn it into reality together!
